My project “CRIMINAL RECORD MANAGEMENT SYSTEM” is a computerized system used to  store and retrieve information about the various crimes committed by the criminals and also the  police who has lodged the FIR against the criminal. The system at any point of time can provide the details of existing charge sheets and their statuses.  The system will provide the details of the police station, the employees , the wanted criminal details , details of victims and the registered FIRs , evidence and their sequence. The system allows the user to lodge an FIR and add a criminal. It allows admin to add or remove a  police, displays details like crime categories, FIR etc. It is a web-based application for complaining and computerized management of crime records. A  person who wishes to file a complaint or report an incident should approach the police and should  give details about themselves as well as the crime. The police then files an FIR and only when the  FIR is approved, the police can add a criminal. On the other hand, only the admin can add or delete police and police stations into the system.  The admin also assigns the login details for each police officer.
